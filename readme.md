# Create with Code
## Unit 1 - Player Control

This is my project for the CWC Unity tutorial. Unity will generate many important files when you load in the project. 

## Features (Original):
* Obstacles with a Rigidbody
* ~~Car that moves forward~~ 
* ~~Car that moves forward, back, left, and right based on input~~ 
* Car that moves forward and back and turns left or right based on input.

## Features (Challenge):
* ~~Plane that moves backwards~~ Plane that moves *forwards*
* ~~Plane that moves extremely dast~~ Plane that moves at a *nice* speed
* ~~Plane tilts by itself using an *advanced* AI~~ Plane is tilted by W/S keys.
* ~~Camera in front of the plane so you can see yourself ;)~~ Camera beside the plane so you don't crash and die a fiery death.
* ~~Sad Lame Stationary nose stick~~ Cool wacky fun awesome moving spinny propeller (with dynamic script).
